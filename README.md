# Features
* Search for a book by ISBN-13, title, author, or Brown course code
 * Our database currently catalogs books used by Brown courses in the Spring 2014 term (Fall 2013 books coming soon)
   * When a user sells a book that isn't in our database, the book will be added and it's relevant information will be gathered 
* Easily see all the offers for a given book in one page
* Subscribe to a book to get an email when a new offer is posted  
* Easily manage your posts and subscriptions


## What We Don't Do
We do not facilitate the transfer of any currency, goods, or services. It is up to the buyer to contact the seller and carry out the transcation.


## TODO:
* Filter search results
* paginate
* sell multiple books in one submit
* optional sign in with facebook/google
* better search
* geographical based search/info storing (for if people in far away lands use this)
* get Fall textbook info
* integrate course scheduler i.e. search for all books required by the courses listed
